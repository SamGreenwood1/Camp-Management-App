A dynamic web application designed to streamline summer camp program management and daily activity scheduling. This app aims to provide a flexible and intelligent system for program directors, unit heads, and activity specialists to manage their camp's daily flow, ensuring a diverse and equitable experience for all campers.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Intelligent Daily Scheduling**: Programmatically assigns cabin groups to activity areas, ensuring equitable rotation (every group visits every area weekly).
*   **Dynamic Cabin Merging**: Adapts schedules seamlessly when cabin groups merge due to camper arrivals or departures.
*   **Centralized Program Bank**: Manage all camp programs, including forms, templates, and resource documents (PDF uploads).
*   **AI-Assisted Program Ingestion**: Planned integration to extract keywords, supplies, and summaries from program documents.
*   **Role-Based Access**: Granular permissions for various staff roles (Admin, Program Director, Unit Head, Activity Department Head, Specialist, Councillor).
*   **PWA with Offline Support**: Accessible as an installable app with offline capabilities, crucial for camp environments.
*   **Authentication & SSO**: Secure login via Clerk, with planned integration for enterprise SSO (WorkOS) and major camp management software.
*   **Supply Requisitions**: Streamlined process for ordering program supplies.

## ü§ù Contributing & Seeking Help

This project is actively under development, and I welcome any contributions or insights!

I learn best by understanding and adapting existing code patterns. If you're looking to help, I'm particularly interested in **concrete code examples, architectural patterns illustrated with small snippets, or step-by-step implementation "recipes"** for new features.

Please refer to `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` for a more detailed description of the project's vision, modules, and specific areas where I'm seeking architectural and implementation guidance.

Feel free to open issues or pull requests.
